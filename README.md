Clack is a modern text editor, built with Python, HTML & CSS, and JavaScript.  
  
## Installing - Windows  
First, you obvioulsly gotta have Python installed. Get it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/), if you don't already.  
After that, you can install the zip file to your PC and extract it.
Next, open up a command prompt window and go to the file location where `clack.py` is., e.g.  
`cd C:\Users\User\Downloads\Clack\clack-main`  
Now, you can type in `python clack.py`  
### TO USE THE .BAT FILE  
There is a windows batch file included. To use this, place the bat file where the `Clack` file is.  
To use it, double click it. *amazing!*  
MAKE SURE NOT TO CLOSE THE CMD WINDOW  
## Installing - Mac

You most likely already have Python installed. Get it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/), if you don't already. (Weirdo)  
After that, you can `git pull` or download the file and extract it.  
Open a terminal window, and type change your directory to where `clack.py` was downloaded., e.g.  
`cd Downloads`  
`cd Clack`  
Nice! Now type  
`python clack.py`
